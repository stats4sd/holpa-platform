        <p class="text-black mb-16">Below you can choose from translations that have been added by projects. Generally, it is better to use an existing translation
            where available to save time and improve harmonisation of survey results. However, if needed you can upload a new translation for your intended language
            by clicking the "Add new translation" button.
